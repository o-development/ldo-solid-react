# Solid-Dataset

Pre-alpha

## Notes:
 - Any quads in the default graph will not be synced to Solid Pods, but will be added to the dataset without any syncing


## TODO:
 - Create an event for each thing that happens. Like "Loaded"
 - You should be able to initialize classes with loading = true so that there isn't a flash on initial load
